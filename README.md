# TomeTracker
Description
For this project, we are creating an application used to manage various table top campaigns, through campaign creation, editing, and character creation and updating. Our main goal was to create a "one stop shop" application that can be utilized by both Dungeon Masters and players for various utilities. 

Developers
Front End Development
Jordan Cox and Andrew Thomas were responsible for the front end portion of this project. They work and effort were directly responsible for establishing the look and feel of the application, as well as functionality regarding JavaScript. 
Back End Development
Together, Vanessa Pursley and Kai Han took charge of the back end systems, combining their talents to bring our database connections to life, as well as navigate the complexity of user authentication. 
How it works
In our application, a user arrives and creates and account or logs in to an existing account. From there, they can chose an existing campaign or create a new campaign, and based on whether they're the owner of the campaign (the Dungeon Master) or a player within the campaign. After selecting the correct campaign, a user is then directed to a dashboard where they can access a character sheet, note section, and lastly an area where you can roll virtual dice. For dungeon masters, there is also an "at a glance" view where they can see all of the players names, their armor, current health points, and their passive perception.
